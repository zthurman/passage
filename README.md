## Hyperion - Chapter 3 (Dan Simmons)

"Look," said Tyrena. "In twentieth-century Old Earth, a fast food chain took dead cow meat, fried it in grease, added
carcinogens, wrapped it in petroleum-based foam, and sold nine hundred billion units. Human beings. Go figure."

## Shadow of the Hegemon - Chapter 4 (Orson Scott Card)

What a laugh, though. To think that one human being could ever really know another. You could get used to each other,
get so habituated that you could speak their words right along with them, but you never knew why other people said what
they said or did what they did, because they never even knew themselves. Nobody understands anybody.

And yet somehow we live together, mostly in peace, and get things done with a high enough success rate that people keep
trying. Human beings get married and a lot of the marriages work, and they have children and most of them grow up to be
decent people, and they have schools and businesses and factories and farms that have results at some level of
acceptability -- all without having a clue what's going on inside anybody's head.

Muddling through, that's what human beings do.

## Tress of the Emerald Sea - Chapter 42 (Brandon Sanderson)

I love memories. They are our ballads, our personal foundation myths. But I must acknowledge that memory *can* be cruel
if left unchallenged.

Memory is often our only connection to who we used to be. Memories are fossils, the bones left by dead versions of
ourselves. More potently, our minds are a hungry audience, craving only the peaks and valleys of experience. The bland
erodes, leaving behind the distinctive bits to be remembered again and again.

Painful or passionate, surreal or sublime, we cherish those little rocks of peak experience, polishing them with the
ever-smoothing touch of recycled proxy living. In so doing -- like pagans praying to a sculpted mud figure -- we make of
our memories the gods which judge our current lives.

I love this. Memory may not be the heart of what makes us human, but it's at least a vital organ. Nevertheless, we must
take care not to let the bliss of the present fade when compared to supposedly better days. We're happy, sure, but were
we *more* happy then? If we let it, memory can make shadows of the now, as nothing can match the buttressed legends of
our past.

...

Those memories aren't alive. You are.
